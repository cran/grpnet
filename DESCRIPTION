Description: Efficient algorithms for fitting generalized linear and additive models with group elastic net penalties as described in Helwig (2024) <doi:10.1080/10618600.2024.2362232>. Implements group LASSO, group MCP, and group SCAD with an optional group ridge penalty. Computes the regularization path for linear regression (gaussian), logistic regression (binomial), multinomial logistic regression (multinomial), log-linear count regression (poisson and negative.binomial), and log-linear continuous regression (gamma and inverse gaussian). Supports default and formula methods for model specification, k-fold cross-validation for tuning the regularization parameters, and nonparametric regression via tensor product reproducing kernel (smoothing spline) basis function expansion.
