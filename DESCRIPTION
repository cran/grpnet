Description: Efficient algorithms for fitting generalized linear models with group elastic net penalties. Implements group lasso, group MCP, and group SCAD with an optional group ridge penalty. Computes the regularization path for linear regression (gaussian), logistic regression (binomial), multinomial logistic regression (multinomial), log-linear count regression (poisson and negative binomial), and log-linear continuous regression (gamma and inverse gaussian). Regularization paths are computed using groupwise majorization descent. Cross-validation routines are available for tuning the regularization parameters.
